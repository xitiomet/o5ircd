Openstatic.org IRC Server
-------------------------

Openstatic irc server is a new approach to irc. Every part of the system is layered.
One of the strengths of this server is its middleware functionality for chatrooms.
Each chatroom is treated like an object and can route its traffic through any number
of middleware classes. This allows each chatroom to act like its own mini-server.

In order to compile the server you will need to do the following on debian based systems

$ sudo apt-get install gcj java-gcj-compat make

then to compile just run make!

This readme is a work in progress. More to come.
