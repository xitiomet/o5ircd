Openstatic.org IRC Server
-------------------------

Openstatic irc server is a new approach to irc. Every part of the system is layered.
One of the strengths of this server is its middleware functionality for chatrooms.
Each chatroom is treated like an object and can route its traffic through any number
of middleware classes. This allows each chatroom to act like its own mini-server.


1. Setup

In order to compile this software using gcj you will need to fist install the gcj packages
for debian based systems with apt you can do the following...

$ sudo apt-get install gcj java-gcj-compat make

If you would like to build using javac run the following

$ make jvm

This will create a version using the java vm instead of gcj

Possible Issues
===================

GCJ
----
Depending on your version of gcj and your environment setup you may have some trouble compiling
please be sure that gcj, javac and jar are in you executable path. Also this program was developed
using gcj 4.3, please be sure that you are using an up to date version of gcj.

JSON
----
Also please note, GCJ may get cranky about the json libs, i have included gcj-json.jar just incase
however the placebohttp.jar lib should have a full json.org implementation built in.
